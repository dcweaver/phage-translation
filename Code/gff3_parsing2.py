    Inputs: 
    gff3_location - location of gff3 file on your computer as a string
    fasta_location - location of fasta file on your computer as a string
    upstream_len - integer specifiying the length of the upstream sequence
    
    Outputs:
    df - returns pandas dataframe with information about the genes in the genome that are coding sequences
    genome - returns a list object that contains the entire raw genome sequence from the selected fasta file
    
    Description of funtion:
    
        Reads in a gff3 file and a fasta file and compiles all of the data in the gff3 file into a dataframe that contains information about the genes inside of the genome such as the strand, location of start/stop codons, etc. and filters out all of the non-coding genes. Then, using a fasta file for the same genome, the coding sequence and the region of nucleotides upstream from the start codon are gathered and appended into new columns.
